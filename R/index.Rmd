Codes and notes for a prospective chapter in *AGRA Africa Agriculture Status Report (AASR) 2017*.

The overall objective of the AASR report is to [@aasr_cn_2017]:  
 
1. provide an overview of the smallholder farmers and how they have adapted to the challenges they face as economic actors; 
2. explore innovative strategies that can substantially raise the productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers; 
3. identify policies and programs that can support the movement of Africa’s farming systems from subsistence-oriented to market-oriented thriving businesses; 
4. identify the necessary conditions, appropriate technologies, and institutions that can propel and support smallholder agriculture businesses; 
5. examine the past and the present role of public and private sector investment in agriculture and the success factors that can be scaled up to accelerate transformation. 


# Methods

The study should provide a context-setting chapter that attempts to characterize, scale, locate, point to prioritization of high-level smallholder commercialization strategies, opportunities and challenges. A proposed approach is to chracterize SHFs and frame business strategies within a 2-by-2 domain framework (low/high rainfed ag potential across low/high market access areas). This approach assumes that agricultural development and adaptation strategies are largely driven by pre-existing bio-physical and spatial conditions.

We propose then focusing on around half a dozen countries for which we have recent/accessible microdata (e.g. LSMS-ISA and maybe AGRA baseline surveys) to look more closely, in the same 2x2 domain framework, at specific farm household and macro characteristics to do two things:  

1. Apply some typology to distinguish between say “predominantly-subsistence” focused and “transitioning-commercial” smallholders  
2. Report on hh level variables that can provide insight into the scale of potential business development challenges and opportunities in each country. 

![(#fig:stan-method) Suggested Approach (05/02/2017)](fig/method-stan_2017.05.02.png)

Key farm and household-level variables to look at may include:

* Time to Market
* Average yield
* Yield gap
* Average size of land holdings
* Share of land harvested
* Production (amount by crop types)
* Consumption
* Rural households population
* Urban households population
* Rural and urban poverty
* Average household size
* Households by head (Male, Female)
* Average age of the individuals 
* Households size
* Education
* Households level income diversification
* Livestock assets
* Ownership of mobile phones
* Households who receive credit
* Households who receive credit from bank or MFI
* Access to extension services
* People in working age (16-64)
* Use of improved technologies and farm management practices
* Average wage rate
* Land rental rate
* Any information on agri-business or agro processing?
